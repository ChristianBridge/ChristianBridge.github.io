### Projects
**College of Information Advising Chatbot**
- Created a RAG‑LLM for the College of Information Data Science Advising Office using locally hosted Meta Llama 3.3‑70b, Hugging Face BAAI/bge‑m3 embedding model, ChromaDB vector storage, and Streamlit UI.
- Evaluated the model with human evaluation metrics and AI metrics resulting in fluency (4.86/5), coherence(4.80/5), relevance (4.42/5), factuality (3.88/5) BERTScore (0.74) and semantic similarity (0.84).

**CNN with LSTM for Image Captioning Flickr 8k**
- Used TensorFlow, Keras, and ResNet50 to create the CNN & LSTM architecture.
- Evaluated the model using loss and accuracy of the human annotated captions and the predicted captions, validation model accuracy was near 40%.

**Pantry - A Personal Food Database**
- Created a personal food storage database using MySQL which stored customer information, pantry items, food nutritional informaiton, and recipes.
- Documented the database entity-relationship diargram, business rules, data dictionary.
