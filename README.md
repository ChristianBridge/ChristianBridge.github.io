### Projects
**College of Information Advising Chatbot**
- Created a RAG‑LLM for the College of Information Data Science Advising Office using locally hosted Meta Llama 3.3‑70b, Hugging Face BAAI/bge‑m3 embedding model, ChromaDB vector storage, and Streamlit UI.
- Evaluated the model with human evaluation metrics and AI metrics resulting in fluency (4.86/5), coherence(4.80/5), relevance (4.42/5), factuality (3.88/5) BERTScore (0.74) and semantic similarity (0.84).
